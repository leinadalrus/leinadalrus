> Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @leinadalrus!

Well o well, I guess I’m interested in programming websites...full-stack!

I wanted to make giant robots, but I settled with programming 'em instead after watching Gundam Destiny as a kid.

And if you wanna know: 

#### Full-stack:

<br>

- `conchord-ng` - the Angular \[16] front-end of Conchord
- `Conchord` is the Vue (and an Angular16 \[signal preview]) and Spring Framework back-end

<br>

#### General Purpose

<br>

- `Annalise` is an experimental naval warfare card-game simulating a multiplayer network

<br>
