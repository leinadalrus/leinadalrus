> Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @leinadalrus!

Well o well, I guess I’m interested in programming websites...full-stack!

I wanted to make giant robots, but I settled with programming 'em instead after watching Gundam Destiny as a kid.

And if you wanna know: 

#### Full-stack:

<br>

- `Astrale` - the .Net C# recreation of Conchord for TTRPGs - ASP.Net Core MVC project with Vue 3 and TypeScript 
- `Conchord` is the Vue (and an Angular16 \[signal preview]) and Spring Framework back-end

<br>

#### General Purpose

<br>

- `Navis` is an experimental naval warfare/war-gaming project

<br>
