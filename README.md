> Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @leinadalrus!

Well o well, I guess I’m interested in programming websites...full-stack!

I wanted to make giant robots, but I settled with programming 'em instead after watching Gundam Destiny as a kid.

And if you wanna know: 

#### Full-stack:

<br>

- `ravens-next` is a project of mine where I try to develop a Real Robot garage builder app, and
- `genobee` is the WebGL2 backend code for the 3D garage component for `leinadalrus/ravens-next`.

<br>

#### Front-end

<br>

- `branch` is the React project remake of `ravens-next`
- `susanoo` is the Spring Boot Framework back-end for `branch`

<br>

#### Back-end

<br>

- `brunch-buns` a fork of `brunch/brunch` employing C/C++ Emscripten

<br>

In general, most of my projects are:

1. developed together
2. since I base my suggestions through my Lighthouse
3. testing with Chromium Dev-tools and JUnit 4
4. and Kotlin
5. (preferably over Java due to composition over inheritance)

<br>
