> Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @leinadalrus!

Well o well, I guess I’m interested in programming websites...full-stack!

I wanted to make giant robots, but I settled with programming 'em instead after watching Gundam Destiny as a kid.

And if you wanna know: 

- `ravens-next` is a project of mine where I try to develop a Real Robot garage builder app, and
- `genobee` is the WebGL2 backend code for the 3D garage component for `leinadalrus/ravens-next`.
- `branch` is the actual Angular project repository for `ravens-next`
- `jash` is the React project remake of `ravens-next`
- `brunch-buns` a fork of `brunch/brunch`
- `breakfast` C/C++ Emscripten source code for `leinadalrus/brunch-buns`

In general, most of my projects are:

1. developed together
2. since I base my suggestions through my Lighthouse
3. testing with Chromium Dev-tools and JUnit 4
4. and Kotlin
5. (preferably over Java due to composition over inheritance)

Contact: How to reach me ... just hit me up on daniel.david.surla@gmail.com, I tend to check my emails every two days or so.

*P.S*
