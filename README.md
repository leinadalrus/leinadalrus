- Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @leinadalrus!.

Well o well, I guess I’m interested in programming websites...full-stack!

I wanted to make giant robots, but I settled with programming 'em instead after watching Gundam Destiny as a kid.

(If you wanna know: Raven's Next is a project of mine where I try to develop a Real Robot garage builder app, and Genobee is the WebGL2 backend code for the 3D garage component.)

Contact: How to reach me ... just hit me up on daniel.david.surla@gmail.com, I tend to check my emails every two days or so.

P.S
  Thanks for reading this!
