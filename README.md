> Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @leinadalrus!

Well o well, I guess I’m interested in programming websites...full-stack!

I wanted to make giant robots, but I settled with programming 'em instead after watching Gundam Destiny as a kid.

And if you wanna know: 

#### Full-stack:

<br>

- `QBao` - Spring Boot and Angular 19.

<br>

#### Software Development

<br>

- `Mirage Works` is an experimental ECU/TCU embedded software diagnostics, logging and manager tool.

<br>

#### Game Development

- `Princess Phever Avenue` - GMTK Game Jam 2024 racing video game project.

<br>
