> Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @leinadalrus!

Well o well, I guess I’m interested in programming websites...full-stack!

I wanted to make giant robots, but I settled with programming 'em instead after watching Gundam Destiny as a kid.

And if you wanna know: 

#### Full-stack:

<br>

- `transpoint` Spring Boot and Vue web-app in tandem with `beydex`
- `levelate` Remix web-app written alongside `gearflat`

<br>

#### Software Development

<br>

- `Mirage-Works` is an experimental ECU/TCU embedded software diagnostics, logging and manager tool
- `beydex` is an mobile app for Beyblade as a database
- `gearflat` product items, parts and bits mobile app

<br>

#### Game Development

- `bhundredbattler` - Personal Car RPG game made in Raylib and Zig (with C++)

<br>
