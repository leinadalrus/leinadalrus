- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @boyemperorpfks!
- I generally just write whatever I fancy, but its mostly audio programming stuff because its fun, and I'm a-bit-of-an-audiophile.

Well o well, I guess...✨👀✨ I’m interested in ... Event...Data...-Driven programming as well as Systems Deployment Operations, or just DevOps in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS, Go and C/C++ because I like how these languages can handle AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.
        And the agnostic nature of C/C++ helps me understand programming conventions and principles better. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are n00b-friendly, new and starting-up/out, or just good old maintenance.

Contact: 📫 How to reach me ... just hit me up on sansanodaniels@gmail.com, I tend to check my emails every two days or so.

P.S
  Thanks for reading this!
