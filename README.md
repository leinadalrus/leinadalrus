> Hi, I’m Daniel Surla, and my handle is @leinadalrus!

Well o well, I guess I’m interested in programming websites...full-stack!

I wanted to make giant robots, but I settled with programming 'em instead after watching Gundam Destiny as a kid.

And if you wanna know: 

#### Full-stack:

<br>

- `conchord` is the Vue (Vite) and Spring Framework back-end

<br>

#### General Purpose

<br>

- `navis` is an experimental naval warfare/war-gaming project

<br>

In general, most of my projects are:

1. developed together
2. since I base my suggestions through my Lighthouse
3. testing with Chromium Dev-tools and JUnit 5 and Playwright

<br>

Contact: How to reach me ... just hit me up on daniel.david.surla@gmail.com, I tend to check my emails every two days or so.
